# dramarduino_oled
A OLED mod for the DRAM Arduino project as designed in https://forum.defence-force.org/viewtopic.php?t=1699

I used an Arduino Nano and the PCB Secco designed for the project.

When using this board with the OLED Mod and a Arduino Nano you have to make a wire bridge from the ground pin of the arduino to the ground pin right to the 5V pin near R1.
